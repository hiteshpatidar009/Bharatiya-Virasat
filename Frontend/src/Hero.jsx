                Holi is the festival of colors celebrated in the spring season
                across India. It marks the victory of good over evil, as it is
                linked to the story of Prahlad and Holika. People celebrate by
                lighting the Holika Dahan bonfire the night before, which
                symbolizes burning away negativity. On the next day, everyone
                plays with colors, water, music, and dance, spreading joy and
                togetherness. Families prepare sweets like gujiya and share
                festive food with relatives and friends. Holi is a festival of
                love, unity, and happiness that brings people closer.

                Lohri is a popular Punjabi festival celebrated in North India,
                especially in Punjab and Haryana, to mark the end of winter and
                the arrival of longer days. It is connected with the harvest of
                crops, especially sugarcane and wheat. People gather around a
                bonfire in the evening, offer sesame seeds, jaggery, and popcorn
                to the fire, and pray for prosperity. The festival is filled
                with folk songs, bhangra, and gidda dances, creating joy and
                energy. Families also celebrate the birth of a child or the
                first Lohri of a newly married couple with great enthusiasm.
                Lohri thus symbolizes gratitude, prosperity, and togetherness.
